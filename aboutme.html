	<h1>about me</h1>
<div class="block-text">
	<p id="abouttext">I am a current senior at Tufts University, where I pursue a double major in Computer Science and Community Health. I consider myself to be driven by passion and impact above all else, and strive in every avenue of my life to dedicate myself towards bettering the lives of others, particularly through advocacy and technology. While my heart belongs to improving the world of healthcare--where I see such great possibility in leveraging technology to promote better health outcomes at a massive scale--my innate passion for technology stems from my eagerness to problem solve, my desire to dissect puzzles piece by piece until I understand them complemetely, and my love for going back and improving upon features of existing programs. I am skilled in database design, data visualization, and programming, and my past work in high intensity CI/CD environments has singled me out as a developer exponentially growing in my programming productivity. In past technical experiences I have led full-stack development on key features to client facing websites, all the way from writing up the product deisgn to the relational database setup to the front-end frameworks. Experience aside, I consider myself a lifelong learner above all else. I have a true, tangible excitement for expanding my knowledge in the technology field and approach every technical challenge with enthusiasm and vigor. My passion, work ethic, dedication, and positive energy stay with me wherever I go, and I look to find others who hold this same passion for changing the world.</p>
