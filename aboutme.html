	<h1>about me</h1>
	<div class="block-text">
		<p>I graduated from Tufts University in 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Community Health and currently work as Software Engineer at Google Health, developing consumer facing technologies. While my time in Google Health has focused on API development, I pursued a variety of activities beyond the realm of engineering while at Tufts; I was an educator and coordinator for the university's chapter of Peer Health Exchange, a teaching assistant for the Computer Science Department's Programming Languages course, and a leader in diversity and equity efforts across various organizations I was a member of. In my final year at Tufts I completed an interdiscplinary thesis entitled "Examining Bias in Machine Learning Tools for the Diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder" where I examined existing gaps in the diagnosis process for ADHD and suggested areas of focus for those seeking to apply a ML based solution to this space. I have had past experiences in a breadth of health areasâ€“including research with clinical trial patients, software engineering at a health technology startup, and case analyses at a medical-legal partnership.</p>

		<p >I am skilled in database design, data visualization, and API development, and primarily work in agile, high intensity environments. In past technical experiences I have led full-stack development on key features to client facing websites and application, including establishing and driving product deisgn, building relational databases, designing and implementing service APIs to support critical user journeys, and developing key components of front-end frameworks. Experience aside, I consider myself to be driven by passion and impact above all else, and strive in every avenue of my life to dedicate myself towards bettering the lives of others, particularly through advocacy and technology. While my heart belongs to improving the world of healthcare--where I see such great possibility in leveraging technology to promote better health outcomes at a massive scale--my innate passion for technology stems from my eagerness to problem solve, my desire to dissect puzzles piece by piece until I understand them complemetely, and my love for going back and improving upon features of existing programs.</p>
