	<h1>about me</h1>
	<p id="abouttext">I am a current junior at Tufts University where I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Community Health. I consider myself to be driven by passion and impact above all else, and strive in every avenue of my life to dedicate myself towards bettering the lives of others, particularly through advocacy and technology. My heart belongs to improving the world of healthcare, where I see such a rich avenue to promote equity among populations contrasted by growing disparities and harm towards vulnerable people. My passion for technology stems from my innate eagerness to problem solve, my desire to dissect puzzles piece by piece until I understand them complemetely, and my love for going back and improving upon an already-functional-but-not-quite-there-yet program. Truly, I am never more engrossed, committed, or focused than when I am tracking down the source of a bug! This love for computer science is only driven that much further by the potential of healthtech to transform the ways in which people can recieve care. My dual studies have given me a unique perspective in how we in the field must go about doing that, while also instilling in me an understanding of the nuance, care, and compassion that must be integrated at every step of the way. </p>
