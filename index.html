	<div id="aboutme">
		<p> I am a public health technologist with a deep passion for ethics. Welcome to my page!</p>
		<p> A software engineer by trade, I have built a career developing mobile applications aimed at placing the power to understand their own health and make decisions upon it back in the hands of users. Now I aim to explore the questions which arise at this intersection of health and technology: What must we consider as we continue to deeply embed AI and digital technology into health processes? How do we ensure that this new age of public health advancement transforms our communities for the better rather than harming us?</p>
		<p> In my off hours I am also a ceramicist, painter, and avid reader. You can find me most weekends playing volleyball at the beach or admiring the herd of bison living in San Franciscoâ€™s Golden Gate Park.</p>
